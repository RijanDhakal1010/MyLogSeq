- # Tables in Lua
- Tables are the only compound data feature Lua has.
	- They are similar to php arrays or js objects, they are hash-lookup dicts that can also be used as lists.
	- In tables, dict literals have string keys by default.
		- t = {key1='value', key2='false'}
			- `print(t.key1)` -- this will print 'value'
			- `t.newKey = {}`  -- Adds a new key/value pair.
			- `t.key2 = nil`   -- Removes key2 from the table.
