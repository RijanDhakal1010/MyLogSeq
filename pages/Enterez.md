- [The ncbi manual for enterez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3837/)
- [The ncbi bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/) might be a good resource to get information on biological material.
- # General Enterez manual notes
- This manual is separated by the various Enterez tools and databases.
- [[Bioproject]]
- # Entrez Manaul
- This section of the notes follow the entrez Manual [readme.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/). The manual is inside the  folder downloaded with `curl`. Seem the manaul might be on this [web-page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) as well.
- ## Introduction
- ### Programmatic access
- The manual says "Each program also has a `-help` command that prints detailed information about available arguments." So, turns out they respond to `-help` and not `--help`.
- ### Navigation function
- It says "Efetch downloads selected records or reports in a style designated by" but also says records and it is not clear if records mean genomic data or not.
- ### Accessory programs
- "Nquire retrieves data from remote servers with URLs constructed from command line arguments" for example "nquire -url http://www.wikidata.org/entity Q22679758" not quite sure how I can get the "Q22679758".
- ## Discovery by navigation

- # Example from the manual
- The following example is built on in the manual (from section to section):
	- `esearch -db pubmed -query "lycopene cyclase" | elink -related | elink -target protein | efilter -organism mouse -source refseq | efetch -format fasta`
		- This works and generates fastas after a series of errors.
